####Page
A web page is a single page of content on a website. Each page can be edited individually in OmniStudio and will contain information within a similar theme.

####Containers
The body will be split into containers which will operate to separate the page into sections. Containers can have multiple types of content within them, and operate like paragraphs in a document to separate content into related sections. For example, one container might include a banner image showcasing what will be on the page, and the next container may have text and a video to further outline the content. 

####Layout 
Content can be rearranged into a layout on the page to best serve the needs of the customers visiting the page. The layout will include a container with the header and footer and other containers in the body.

    5. Environment. See below for detailed field descriptions.

Click on the **Create** button.

### Types of Tickets 


#### Question Ticket

Question tickets will describe precisely what information you're looking for or what you're trying to do, while also providing the context of the question so we can give an accurate answer.

If the question is too complex or too dependent on the business context, the Support team can suggest a consulting service so Nuxeo can analyze the customer needs more precisely and provide a more complete answer.


##### Bug Ticket

Once you have determined that there is a bug beyond an issue with the operation of the platform or incident linked to the customer's developments please submit a Bug Ticket. To do so, check that your scenario can be reproduced on multiple devices or platforms.

If not sure, it is better to create a "Problem" issue for which the customer provides more information.

In case of a bug, it is essential to provide the Support team with a way to reproduce the bug. Please provide:



*   the step-by-step scenario to reproduce the bug;


*   the server logs: you can try to extract the last stack trace from the console or the server.log file or the message displayed on the web user interface;


*   a screenshot showing the user interface before and after the bug, if relevant.


*   Even if only one of these elements might be enough to identify the bug, the better the bug is described, the quicker and more efficiently the bug will be fixed.

#### Problem Ticket

This type is for incidents linked to the customer's developments. In that case, provide the elements needed in case of a bug and you should also:



*   Provide the plugins you developed AND/OR the developments you think are related to the problem (Java classes, templates, unit tests, XML configuration files),


*   Identify the last changes done on the platform since the moment it worked fine.


*   attach the Studio plugin (.jar file) used at the time of the tests to the JIRA ticket,


*   put a tag on the Studio project, named from the JIRA ticket.


*   On a production environment, it is important to identify the date at which the incident occurred, to find the corresponding errors in the logs.

#### Improvement Ticket

This type is for behaviors that are not available by default on the platform and that you would like to implement. It enables you to ask the PeakActivity team for bits of advice or good practices to implement new features. For this type of ticket, you just need to indicate the desired feature and possible constraints in the Description field.


### Process Flow for Issue Reporting 

Once a JIRA ticket has been submitted, the ticket will be labeled with the following support levels. 	From there, the PeakActivity team will log the report in JIRA, and communicate via email to the appropriate response team.  



#### Resolution 

An incident shall be deemed to have been resolved upon the occurrence of, but not limited to, any one of the following events:



*   
The incident cannot, despite reasonable efforts, be reproduced by PeakActivity or Client; unless the same fault is reported two (2) or more times or by multiple (two or more) end-users.


*   
PeakActivity has confirmed to Client that the system behavior is as per the original solution design.


*   
Client confirms the incident has ceased or been resolved. 


*   
When there are no responses/inputs received from Client for open incidents and PeakActivity has sent two reminders, in which event the case is will be closed after 5 business days. 

#### Records 

PeakActivity shall maintain a record of all submitted error reports and track PeakActivity actions toward problem resolution.  Reported errors shall be assigned a severity level based on the table set forth below.
