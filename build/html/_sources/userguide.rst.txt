The body will be split into containers which will operate to separate
the page into sections. Containers can have multiple types of content

a banner image showcasing what will be on the page, and the next
container may have text and a video to further outline the content.

problem.

   2. Logs

   4. Customer development
   5. Environment. See below for detailed field descriptions.

Click on the **Create** button.

Types of Tickets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Question Ticket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Question tickets will describe precisely what information you're looking
for or what you're trying to do, while also providing the context of the
question so we can give an accurate answer.

If the question is too complex or too dependent on the business context,
the Support team can suggest a consulting service so Nuxeo can analyze
the customer needs more precisely and provide a more complete answer.

Bug Ticket
''''''''''

Once you have determined that there is a bug beyond an issue with the
operation of the platform or incident linked to the customer's
developments please submit a Bug Ticket. To do so, check that your
scenario can be reproduced on multiple devices or platforms.

If not sure, it is better to create a "Problem" issue for which the
customer provides more information.

In case of a bug, it is essential to provide the Support team with a way
to reproduce the bug. Please provide:

-  the step-by-step scenario to reproduce the bug;

-  the server logs: you can try to extract the last stack trace from the
   console or the server.log file or the message displayed on the web
   user interface;

-  a screenshot showing the user interface before and after the bug, if
   relevant.

-  Even if only one of these elements might be enough to identify the
   bug, the better the bug is described, the quicker and more
   efficiently the bug will be fixed.

Problem Ticket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This type is for incidents linked to the customer's developments. In
that case, provide the elements needed in case of a bug and you should
also:

-  Provide the plugins you developed AND/OR the developments you think
   are related to the problem (Java classes, templates, unit tests, XML
   configuration files),

-  Identify the last changes done on the platform since the moment it
   worked fine.

-  attach the Studio plugin (.jar file) used at the time of the tests to
   the JIRA ticket,

-  put a tag on the Studio project, named from the JIRA ticket.

-  On a production environment, it is important to identify the date at
   which the incident occurred, to find the corresponding errors in the
   logs.

Improvement Ticket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This type is for behaviors that are not available by default on the
platform and that you would like to implement. It enables you to ask the
PeakActivity team for bits of advice or good practices to implement new
features. For this type of ticket, you just need to indicate the desired
feature and possible constraints in the Description field.

Process Flow for Issue Reporting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a JIRA ticket has been submitted, the ticket will be labeled with
the following support levels. From there, the PeakActivity team will log
the report in JIRA, and communicate via email to the appropriate
response team.

Resolution
^^^^^^^^^^

An incident shall be deemed to have been resolved upon the occurrence
of, but not limited to, any one of the following events:

-  The incident cannot, despite reasonable efforts, be reproduced by
   PeakActivity or Client; unless the same fault is reported two (2) or
   more times or by multiple (two or more) end-users.

-  PeakActivity has confirmed to Client that the system behavior is as
   per the original solution design.

-  Client confirms the incident has ceased or been resolved.

-  When there are no responses/inputs received from Client for open
   incidents and PeakActivity has sent two reminders, in which event the
   case is will be closed after 5 business days.

Records
^^^^^^^

PeakActivity shall maintain a record of all submitted error reports and
track PeakActivity actions toward problem resolution. Reported errors
shall be assigned a severity level based on the table set forth below.
