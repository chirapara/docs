Creating Multiple Sites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

merceStudio has the ability to have multiple ‘sites.’ A site is a
collection of pages with their own hierarchy of how they relate to each
other. These can be used for franchise users so that they can be
assigned a site and curate only that site. Here are the necessary terms:

**Site**: A collection of navigation trees. When a user is associated
with a site, and they log in to studio, they will ONLY see navigation
trees associated with that site.

**Navigation Tree**: nothing more than a collection of pages. They are
used for defining a navigation structure in the header or footer.

**Page**: A block or collection of content.

**Page Content Block**: Images, Video, Text Fields

A user that is not assigned to a specific site, can curate all sites.
