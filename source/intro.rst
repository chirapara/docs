General terms
-------------

**SEO**

Search engine optimization. Increase the visibility of your site to
users of a web search engine by adding custom meta tags such as keywords
and descriptions to each page that you author in merceStudio

**Toolbars**

merceStudio has two navigational toolbars, an upper toolbar and a left
toolbar. The global tool appears at the top of the page and helps you
navigate between the core sections of merceStudio. This is consistent
across all sections (Pages, Blogs, Products, and Themes). The left
toolbar will have options related to the page you’re on such as site
routes, and blog categories.

**Blog**

A blog an informational page published on a site consisting of often
informal text and media usually helping customers understand some part
of your company or products.

**Route**

A route in merceStudio is the location of the page in the structure of
the site. The route can be changed by dragging and dropping in the left
toolbar.

Website structure terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Site**

The term “site” (shortened from “website”) is a collection of linked
pages associated with a single organization. Your site will encompass
the entirety of the content contained within your domain name.

**Page**

A web page is a single page of content on a website. Each page can be
edited individually in merceStudio and will contain information within a
similar theme. On each 'page' a header, navigation bar, and footer will
be included automatically. merceStudio allows you to edit only the
'body' of each page.

**Body**

The body of a site is the content that will be displayed on the page.
There are types of content that can be placed in the body. Videos, text,
and images are the most common types of content which can be placed into
the body. In merceStudio, you can edit each content type within your
pages.

**Containers**

The body will be split into containers that will operate to separate the
page into sections. Containers can have multiple types of content within
them, and operate like paragraphs in a document to separate content into
related sections. For example, one container might include a banner
image showcasing what will be on the page, and the next container may
have the text and a video to further outline the content.

**Layout**

Content can be rearranged into a **layout** on the page to best serve
the needs of the customers visiting the page. The layout will
automatically include a container with the navigation bar, header, and
footer as well as other containers that you can edit in the body.

Content types
